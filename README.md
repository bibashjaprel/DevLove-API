# ❤️ DevLove API 
### Because My Girlfriend Deserves Automated Romance

Developer-style Pickup Line API for People Who Love Code as Much as They Love Their Girl

---

## 💌 Why I Built This

I’m a developer… which means:

- I can automate my deployments
- I can automate database backups

So why not automate my girlfriend’s daily pickup lines? 😭❤️

This project started because my girlfriend always says:

> “You never flirt first.”

So I made a whole API to fix that 😎
Now I can send her random cute lines automatically, without forgetting, without overthinking…
Just pure DevOps-powered romance.

## 🌸 What This API Does

This API generates random developer-style pickup lines, in categories like:

- 🐹 Golang love
- 🐳 Docker flirt mode
- ⚙️ GitOps romance
- ☸️ Kubernetes chaos-love
- ❤️ Pure romantic mode

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "category": "golang",
  "line": "Are you a goroutine? Because my heart keeps running every time I think of you."
}
```

## 💕 Problem This Solves

Real talk:

- Sometimes you’re busy
- Sometimes you’re debugging real life
- Sometimes the brain is empty
- But the girlfriend still expects “cute message now 😡❤️”

This API saves relationships.
This API saves time.
This API saves your sanity.
